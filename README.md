## Coursework for the ECM1400 Programming module at the University of Exeter

This was a first-year programming coursework, where I achieved 94% (high first-class classification).

In this coursework, I designed, wrote, and tested a Python program to load pollution data from a REST API and created tools to analyse it. There was also a second module in which I wrote an image processing algorithm to analyse a picture of a map.
